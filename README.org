=makem=.sh is a script helps to build, lint, and test Emacs Lisp packages.  It aims to make linting and testing as simple as possible without requiring per-package configuration.

It works similarly to a Makefile in that "rules" are called to perform actions such as byte-compiling, linting, testing, etc.

Source and test files are discovered automatically from the project's Git repo, and package dependencies within them are parsed automatically.

Output is simple: by default, there is no output unless errors occur.  With increasing verbosity levels, more detail gives positive feedback.  Output is colored by default to make reading easy.

When desired, [[https://github.com/alphapapa/emacs-sandbox.sh][emacs-sandbox.sh]] can be used as a backend, which allows package dependencies to be installed automatically into a clean Emacs "sandbox" configuration without affecting the developer's personal configuration.  This is especially helpful when upstream dependencies may have released new versions that differ from those installed in the developer's personal configuration.

Some example output.  The first shows running the =test= rule with verbosity level 1, which shows which tests are run but omits each test's output unless it fails:

[[images/make-test-v.png]]

Increasing the verbosity shows green output for passing tests:

[[images/make-test-vv.png]]

The =lint-compile= rule treats byte-compiler warnings as errors:

[[images/make-lint-compile.png]]

The =all= rule runs all rules and treats warnings as errors:

[[images/make-all.png]]

Of course, with increased verbosity, it also shows which rules did not signal errors:

[[images/make-all-v.png]]

* Installation

Copy =makem.sh= into your package's root directory.  Optionally, also copy =Makefile=, to make calling the script easier.

* Usage
:PROPERTIES:
:TOC:      0
:END:

The =makem.sh= script can be called directly or through a =Makefile=.  Use =makem.sh --help= to list available rules.

** Makefile

A default =Makefile= is provided which calls the =makem.sh= script.  Call it with the name of a rule and an optional verbosity level, like:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  # Run all rules.
  $ make

  # Run all lints.
  $ make lint

  # Run all tests.
  $ make test

  # Run ERT tests with verbosity level 1.
  $ make v=v test-ert

  # Run Buttercup tests with verbosity level 2.
  $ make v=vv test-buttercup

  # Run tests with emacs-sandbox.sh and automatically install dependencies.
  $ make sandbox=t autoinstall=t test
#+END_SRC

** Script

The script may be called directly to specify additional options.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  makem.sh [OPTIONS] RULES...

  Rules:
    all      Run all lints and tests.
    compile  Byte-compile source files.

    lint           Run all lints.
    lint-checkdoc  Run checkdoc.
    lint-compile   Byte-compile source files with warnings as errors.
    lint-package   Run package-lint.

    test, tests     Run all tests.
    test-buttercup  Run Buttercup tests.
    test-ert        Run ERT tests.

  Options:
    -d, --debug    Print debug info.
    -h, --help     I need somebody!
    -v, --verbose  Increase verbosity, up to -vv.
    --debug-load-path  Print load-path.

    -f FILE, --file FILE  Check FILE in addition to discovered files.

    --no-color        Disable color output.
    -C, --no-compile  Don't compile files automatically.

  Sandbox options:
    These require emacs-sandbox.sh to be on your PATH.  Find it at
    <https://github.com/alphapapa/emacs-sandbox.sh>.

    --sandbox              Run Emacs with emacs-sandbox.sh.
    --auto-install         Automatically install package dependencies.
    -i, --install PACKAGE  Install PACKAGE before running rules.

  Source files are automatically discovered from git, or may be
  specified with options.

  Package dependencies are discovered from "Package-Requires" headers in
  source files.
