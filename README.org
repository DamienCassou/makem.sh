=makem.sh= is a script to help build and test Emacs Lisp packages (not Emacs itself).  It aims to make linting and testing as simple as possible.  Source files and test files are discovered automatically from the project's Git repo.  Output is simple: by default, there is no output unless errors occur.  With increasing verbosity levels (with =-v= or =-vv= options), more detail gives positive feedback.  Output is colored by default to make reading easy.

** Rules

Similar to a Makefile, =makem.sh= has several rules which can be run:

+  =all= :: Run all lints and all tests.
+  =compile= :: Byte-compile source files.

*Linting*

Lints are run on non-test source files.

+  =lint= :: Run all lints.
+  =lint-checkdoc= :: Run =checkdoc=.
+  =lint-compile= :: Byte-compile source files, signaling warning as errors.
+  =lint-package= :: Run =package-lint=.

*Testing*

ERT and Buttercup tests are discovered automatically.  Source files are byte-compiled before testing by default.

+  =test=, =tests= :: Run all tests.
+  =test-buttercup= :: Run Buttercup tests.
+  =test-ert= :: Run ERT tests.

** Options

  +  =-d=, =--debug= :: Print debug info.
  +  =-h=, =--help= :: I need somebody!
  +  =-v=, =--verbose= :: Increase verbosity.  May be given up to 2 times.

  +  =-f FILE=, =--file FILE= :: Check FILE in addition to discovered files.

  +  =--no-color= :: Disable color output.
  +  =-C=, =--no-compile= ::  Don't compile files automatically.
