=makem.sh= is a script to help build and test Emacs Lisp packages (not Emacs itself).  It aims to make linting and testing as simple as possible.  Source files and test files are discovered automatically from the project's Git repo.  Output is simple: by default, there is no output unless errors occur.  With increasing verbosity levels (with =-v= or =-vv= options), more detail gives positive feedback.  Output is colored by default to make reading easy.
