** TODO Fix/explain issues regarding byte-compilation order

Because the order in which files are byte-compiled is not guaranteed, and because the =lint-compile= rule compiles all files in a single Emacs session, it can obscure compilation errors which would occur if each file were compiled in a separate session.  It seems that =package.el= can behave similarly, because it may compile a package's files without errors even though errors could occur if each file in the package were compiled in a separate session.

*** TODO Add option to byte-compile files individually

*** TODO Document this issue

* Ideas

** TODO Set Emacs frame title in interactive sandbox
